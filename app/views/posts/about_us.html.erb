          Fight for Felines started with two girls, who each had four cats of their own.</br>
          We both knew there <i>had</i> to be a way for us to directly help other kitties, even though we couldn't possibly house any more.</br>
        </p>
        <p class="post-gar-text">
          We started working with local shelters to spay and neuter feral cats while spreading information about its importance.
          We've learned over the years that the problem isn't going to be solved overnight and want to continue our fight to better
          the lives of disadvantaged cats and kittens.

          It was a cold morning, Christmas Eve of 2019. Our founder decided she didn't want to celebrate Christmas this year, she wanted to
          save some cats. She had already done plenty of research and decided to call
          <%= link_to 'Utah Valley Animal Shelter', "https://www.uvar.us/adoptworkingcats.html", class: 'blue-text-link' %> and adopt six working/feral cats.

          Because URIs are so prevelant during the winter and two of my new babies had visible and obvious symptoms, I decided to bring
          the feline crew into my inside office space that was not being used at the time. (I should state that UVAR strongly advises <i>against</i>
          this, for many reasons, but I personally felt the need to do so).
        </p>
        <p class="post-gar-text">
          After bringing them all inside and spending more time with everyone, I found myself quickly becoming friends with three of them.
